# Project Overview

Messageformat is an [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) project,
and we follow its [Code of Conduct](https://code-of-conduct.openjsf.org/).

The project's current focus is on building JavaScript support for MessageFormat 2.
Versions of `messageformat` and `@messageformat/core` prior to v4
provide JavaScript support for ICU MessageFormat, i.e. "MessageFormat 1".
Documentation for those is found at [messageformat.github.io/mf1](https://messageformat.github.io/mf1).

Our current governance is pretty straightforward;
our core contributor [Eemeli Aro](https://github.com/eemeli) is in charge.
If you'd like to have a say too, active participation is a really good way forward.
