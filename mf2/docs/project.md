# Project Overview

Messageformat is an [OpenJS Foundation](https://openjsf.org) project,
and we follow its [Code of Conduct](https://code-of-conduct.openjsf.org/).

The project's current focus is on building JavaScript support for
Unicode MessageFormat, aka "MessageFormat 2" or "MF2".
Versions of `messageformat` and `@messageformat/core` prior to v4
provide JavaScript support for ICU MessageFormat, i.e. "MessageFormat 1".
Documentation for those is found at [messageformat.github.io/mf1](https://messageformat.github.io/mf1).

Our **long-term goal** is to make significant parts of this project obsolete
by working with the [Unicode MessageFormat Working Group](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg)
and [TC39](https://tc39.es/) to bring Unicode MessageFormat support to JavaScript
as [Intl.MessageFormat](https://github.com/tc39/proposal-intl-messageformat).

`messageformat` v4 is available under the [Apache License, Version 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
Earlier versions are available under the [MIT License](https://opensource.org/license/mit).

Our current governance is pretty straightforward;
our core contributor [Eemeli Aro](https://github.com/eemeli) is in charge.
If you'd like to have a say too, active participation is a really good way forward.
