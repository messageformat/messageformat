# messageformat.github.io

These docs are hosted by [GitHub Pages] at [messageformat.github.io/messageformat], and are generated by [JSDoc], using a [custom fork] of the [DocStrap] template and some command-line magic.

To re-build the docs, run `make docs` in the project root. As the links are slightly prettified (dropping the .html extensions), if you want to view them locally, you may want to run something like `npx http-server` in this directory.
